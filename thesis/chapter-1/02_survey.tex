\section{Literature Survey}
The first work on luminosity correlation of GRBs was done by \cite{schaefer2007hubble}. \cite{li2007variation} shows that not all luminosity correlations are applicable across all redshifts. \cite{basilakos2008testing} prooves otherwise. \cite{wang2011updated} shows that is not true. \cite{tang2021model} have model independetently verified this using deep learning.
