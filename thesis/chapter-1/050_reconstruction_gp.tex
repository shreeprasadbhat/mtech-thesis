\section{Reconstruction and calibration of distance modulus using Gaussian Processes}
\label{results_gp_pantheon}
We first use Gaussian processes to  reconstruct $\mu-z$ relation from pantheon data. Gaussian processes can construct function without involving any model assumption. The Gaussian processes only depend on the covariance function $k(x, x')$, which characterizes the correlation between the function value at $x$ to that at $x'$. There are many covariance functions available, but any covariance function should be positive definite and monotonously decreasing with the increment of distance between $x$ and $x'$. Here we use the following kernel
\begin{equation}\label{eq_kernel}
	\text{k(x, x') = ConstantKernel() + 1.0 * DotProduct(1) ** 0.1}
\end{equation}
Our kernel \eqref{eq_kernel} is a sum of linear, constant kernels. Linear Kernel with exponent is used to capture relation in the data, constant kernel is used as scale magnitude.
