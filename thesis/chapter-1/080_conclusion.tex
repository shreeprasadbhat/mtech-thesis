GRB are essential to extend the Hubble Diagram(HD) to higher redshift and study the nature of dark energy in higher redshift. Luminosity distance of GRBs needs to calibrated using luminosity indicators. This calibration depends on the redshift-distance modulus relation. Here explore model independent ways namely, Gaussian Processes and Deep Learning to reconstruct the $/mu-z$ relation, hence avoid circularity problem. We found that not all luminosity correlation are redshift dependent. Specifically $E_{peak}-E_{\gamma}$ relation has no evidence for redshift dependence. Hence we use it calibrate luminosity distance and obtain tight constraints on dark energy parameters.
