The GRB dataset we use is from Wang et al. In Table 1, we list the variables of 116 GRBs that we use in fitting luminosity correlations
\subsection{Pantheon}
Pantheon compilation (Scolnic et al. 2018) is the combined sample of SNe Ia discovered from different surveys to form the largest sample consisting of total of 1048 SNe Ia raning from 0.01 < z < 2.3.
