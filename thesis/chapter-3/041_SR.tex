\subsection{Symbolic Regression}

Symbolic regression (SR) is a novel machine-learning technique that approximates the relation between an input and an output through analytic mathematical formulae (\cite{schmidt2009distilling} \cite{udrescu2020ai} \cite{wu2019toward} \cite{cranmer2020discovering} \cite{villaescusa2021camels} \cite{kim2020integration} \cite{liu2021machine}). The advantage of using SR over other ML regression models like RF or deep neural networks is that it provides analytic expressions that can be readily generalized and that facilitate understanding the underlying physics. Furthermore, SR is shown to outperform other ML models when the size of dataset is small\cite{wilstrup2021symbolic}.
